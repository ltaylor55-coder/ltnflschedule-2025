# NFL Schedules Website

This project is for my Web Programming class.  
It shows the 2025 NFL schedules for NFC teams (Weeks 1–4).  

## Features
- Uses **HTML lists** to show each team’s schedule.  
- Includes an **image tag (`<img>`)** to display the NFL logo (void tag).  
- Includes additional tags like `<p>`, `<h1>`, and `<hr>`.
